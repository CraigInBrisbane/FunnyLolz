# FunnyLolz
## Overview
Attached is some code written for an interview test. The requirement was to:

Create an application that accesses a 3rd party API, displaying data on the screen in any way suitable. To achieve this, I decided to be funny, and create an old school Console app to display the data, and connecte to a new school Web API endpoint which I wrote. This would use basic httpClient.

From there, the API will connect to the 3rd part endpoint, retreive data and return a formatted response to the client.

Ideas to demonstrate:

* Dependency injection on the API layer, to assist with unit testing.
* Dependency injection of httpClient in the API layer.
* Error handling
* Unit Testing (XUnit)
* Layered application development to assist with unit testing and code segragation
* Linq to handle searches of data for the term searches
* Swagger as and Endpoint documentation tool
* JWT Tokens to achieve some form of security

Unfortunately, I expended my time, probably due to over-engineering, but I wanted to demonstrate key askpects of my development.
